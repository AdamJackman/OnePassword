# OnePassword
Developing Chrome extension that will hash your single/simple password with a different salt for each visited site.

The idea is to be unique from other  password managers by not storing passwords encrypted or not. I will simply store a randomised salt for each site.
This means a user can use the same password no matter how simple for all sites, this app will use encryption
in order to spit out an extremely strong password of desired length.

 This demo will demonstrate the basic features of the extension:

 In all examples the source word "test" is used. We see that for different sites a different password output is given.
 
 A different user using the same source and site will obviously also get a different output.
Any time returning to a site and using the source word the password for that site will be given.
Essentially giving you a unique and strong password for all websites from an extremely simple source word that can remain the same for all sites.
