# OnePassword
Developing Chrome extension that will hash your single/simple password with a different salt for each visited site.

The Idea is to trump password managers by not storing passwords encrypted or not. I will simply store a randomised salt for each site.
This means a user can use the same password no matter how simple for all sites, this app will use encryption
in order to spit out an extremely strong password of desired length.
